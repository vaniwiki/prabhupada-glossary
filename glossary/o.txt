====== Glossary O ======

===== Objective reality =====
The external reality to which our language and perceptions refer.

===== Occult, Occult quality =====
References to the occult were made by Aristotle in his Ethics. He considered occult any effect of nature for which a cause could not be demonstrated. Hence, the occult qualities of nature (for instance, magnetism) could not be subject to scientific inquiry. The New Philosophy viewed all natural phenomena to be occult, since it considered science before the seventeenth century hopelessly inadequate for discovering causation. Though nature's qualities were occult, it was believed that scientific inquiry of a more aggressive kind than Aristotle had conceived of could unlock her secrets. See [[n#New Philosophy|New Philosophy]].
