According to the law of karma, if we cause pain and suffering to other living beings, we must endure pain and suffering in return; One of the five tattvas, or Vedic ontological truths: the activity or work which the embodied living entity performs with the karmendriya, as well as the resultant reaction. The soul receives the due reaction to work by taking his next birth in a subhuman species, or the human species, or a superhuman species. Or the soul may be liberated from birth and death altogether.

Karma dedicated in sacrifice as directed by Vedic injunctions raises the quality of a human being's work. Sacrifice culminates in activity dedicated only to Lord Kṛṣṇa's service. Such transcendental karma is called naiṣkarma.

===== Kṛṣṇa ===== 

Literally, the all-attractive Lord; the main Sanskrit name of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the source of all incarnations, and no one is equal to Him or greater than Him. The Vedas glorify His partial incarnations (which include the demigods), His impersonal Brahman effulgence, His almighty Nārāyaṇa feature with four hands, and at last His superexcellent pastimes as the most sublime youth who herds millions of cows in the forest of Vṛndāvana and dances with millions of cowherd girls (gopīs). There is nothing to compare with this, the two-armed form of the Lord, blackish like a rain cloud, with reddish lotus eyes and a world-enchanting smile. In the material world the owner of the body is called the soul, and the body is called a material designation. In the spiritual Vaikuṇṭha world, however, there is no such distinction. The owner of the body is not different from the body, for both are pure spirit. The divine body of Lord Kṛṣṇa in Vaikuṇṭha is the first and the cynosure of all spiritual forms. He is eternal, and His appearance within the material world as an avatāra is perpetual. Kṛṣṇa is personally Bhagavān, the possessor of six opulences in unlimited fullness: wealth, strength, beauty, knowledge, fame and renunciation. Semi-personally and impersonally, Kṛṣṇa is represented by the Supersoul and the brahma-jyotir Besides all-attractive, the name Kṛṣṇa also means the whole of existence and He who stops birth and death. Kṛṣṇa has unlimited other names like Govinda, Gopāla, Mukunda and Hari. These holy names are nondifferent from Him and indicate the forms He displays in His various pleasure pastimes.
