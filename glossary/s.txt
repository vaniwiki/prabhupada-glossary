===== Saṁsāra =====
the cycle of repeated birth and death in the material world; The baddha-jīva (conditioned soul), captivated by the modes of material nature, is moved as if on a wheel through 8,400,000 kinds of births, lifetime after lifetime. At the lower range of the cycle are births within aquatic, vegetative and animal forms. At the middle range are births within human forms. At the upper range are births within superhuman forms, such as the demigods. But as high as the soul may reach, even up to the position of Brahmā, there is no freedom from saṁsāra. Impelled by prakṛti, kāla and karma, the jīva will surely be forced into another womb, until the day that soul surrenders to the origin of the force that turns the wheel of saṁsārathe īśvara, Kṛṣṇa. The materialistic theory of evolution put forward by Anaximander and Darwin imperfectly recapitulates the Vedic description of the cycle of birth and death. It is true that we were once microbes, fish, reptiles, mammals and apes. But who are we? We are spirit souls. Materialists have no knowledge of the soul. They are unable to explain how and why dead matter assumes the forms of the gradient species. The Vedas explain that the gradient species mark the evolution and devolution of the soul's material desires.

He took sannyāsa at a very tender age and wrote commentaries establishing an impersonal philosophy similar to Buddhism, substituting Brahman (Spirit) for the void. He traveled all over India defeating the great scholars of the day and converting them to his doctrine of Māyāvāda, the advaita (non-dualism) interpretation of the Upaniṣads and Vedānta. He left the world at the age of 33; The incarnation of Śiva who appeared about 1400 years ago in South India to propagate Advaita Vedānta. He taught that Brahman is impersonal, there is no individuality apart from Brahman (all souls are really one soul), the cosmic manifestation does not emanate from Brahman, and the cosmic manifestation is without reality, like a hallucination. Though his philosophy is a distortion of the Vedic teachings, his mission was very important. He turned the Indian people away from Buddhism, back to the Vedas.

===== Śāstra =====
the revealed scriptures, obeyed by all those who follow the Vedic teachings. Śās means "to regulate and direct" and tra means "an instrument"; Vedic literature; The Vedic scriptures; one of the three authorities for a Vaiṣṇava. In his purport to Cc., Ādi-līlā 17.157, Śrīla Prabhupāda writes: The word śāstra is derived from the dhātu, or verbal root, śas. Śas-dhātu pertains to controlling or ruling. A government's ruling through force or weapons is called śastra. Thus whenever there is ruling, either by weapons or by injunctions, the śas-dhātu is the basic principle. Between śastra (ruling through weapons) and śāstra (ruling through the injunctions of the scriptures), the better is śāstra. Our Vedic scriptures are not ordinary law books of human common sense; they are the statements of factually liberated persons unaffected by the imperfectness of the senses. Śāstra must be correct always, not sometimes correct and sometimes incorrect. In the Vedic scriptures, the cow is described as a mother. Therefore she is a mother for all time; it is not, as some rascals say, that in the Vedic age she was a mother but she is not in this age. If śāstra is an authority, the cow is a mother always; she was a mother in the Vedic age, and she is a mother in this age also. If one acts according to the injunctions of śāstra, he is freed from the reactions of sinful activity. For example, the propensities for eating flesh, drinking wine and enjoying sex life are all natural to the conditioned soul. The path of such enjoyment is called pravṛtti-mārga. The śāstra says, pravṛttir eṣāṁ bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalā: one should not be carried away by the propensities of defective conditioned life; one should be guided by the principles of the śāstras. A child's propensity is to play all day long, but it is the injunction of the śāstras that the parents should take care to educate him. The śāstras are there just to guide the activities of human society. But because people do not refer to the instructions of śāstras, which are free from defects and imperfections, they are therefore misguided by so-called educated teachers and leaders who are full of the deficiencies of conditioned life.

===== Śāstra-cakṣuḥ =====
seeing everything through the medium of the Vedic literature; Cakṣuṣa means eyes; śāstra-cakṣuṣa means seeing through the eyes of scripture, as opposed to gross sense perception or mental speculation.

===== Scepticism =====
A state of doubting that may range from a tentative doubt in the process of reaching certainty to complete, total disbelief in everything. Usually, scepticism refers to a philosophy of disbelief, of which there are many. In India, the philosophies of Cārvaka Muni, the Buddhists and the Jains are founded upon disbelief in the Vedas. Māyāvādīs claim to accept the Vedas, but they sceptically reject the Vedic philosophy of Vaiṣṇavism. As Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, a famous Māyāvādī scholar, wrote about the teachings of ācārya Rāmānuja: Rāmānuja's beautiful stories of the other world, which he narrates with the confidence of one who had personally assisted at the origination of the world, carry no conviction. These are the words of a man confined to a miniscule spectrum of awareness by his pratyakṣa and anumāna. Yet he thinks he can pass judgement on that which is beyond his senses and mind. There are many forms of Western scepticism as well, which go back to the ancient Greeks.

===== Six systems =====
There are six systems of philosophy associated with the Vedic scriptures. These together are known as the ṣaḍ-darśana. The ṣaḍ-darśana (six views) are: 1) Nyāya (logic), 2) Vaiśeṣika (atomic theory), 3) Sāṅkhya (analysis of matter and spirit), 4) Yoga (the discipline of self-realization), 5) Karma-mīmāṁsā (the science of fruitive work) and 6) Vedānta (the science of God realization). The ṣaḍ-darśana are termed āstika philosophies (from asti, or it is so), because they all acknowledge the Veda as authoritative, as opposed to the nāstika philosophies of the Cārvakas, Buddhists and Jains (nāsti, it is not so), who reject the Vedas. Beginning with Nyāya, each of the ṣaḍ-darśana in their turn presents a more developed and comprehensive explanation of the aspects of Vedic knowledge. Nyāya sets up the rules of philosophical debate and identifies the basic subjects under discussion: the physical world, the soul, God and liberation. Vaiśeṣika engages the method of Nyāya or logic in a deeper analysis of the predicament of material existence by showing that the visible material forms to which we are all so attached ultimately break down into invisible atoms. Sāṅkhya develops this analytical process further to help the soul become aloof to matter. Through Yoga, the soul awakens its innate spiritual vision to see itself beyond the body. Karma-mīmāṁsā directs the soul to the goals of Vedic ritualism. Vedānta ultimately focuses on the supreme spiritual goal taught in the Upaniṣads. As can be seen in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the basis of these darśanas was an original, unified spiritual science (bhagavad-tattva-vijñāna) taught in very olden times by the twelve Mahājanas: Brahmā, Nārada, Śiva, Kumāras, Kapila, Manu, Prahlāda, Janaka, Bhīṣma, Bali, Śukadeva and Yamarāja. But due to the influence of māyā, scholars who followed the teachings of later sages like Gautama, Kaṇāda, Nirīśvara Kapila, Patañjali and Jaimini, became divided and contentious. The Vedic philosophy was misunderstood, and opposing schools came into being to serve sectarian ends. For instance, Karma-mīmāṁsā (which by 500 BC had become the foremost philosophy of the brāhmaṇa class) was misused by bloodthirsty priests to justify their mass slaughter of animals in Vedic sacrifices. But the unexpected rise of a novel non-Vedic religion challenged the power of Karma-mīmāṁsā. This new religion was Buddhism. By 250 BC, the influence of Karma-mīmāṁsā and other darśanas had weakened considerably. When King Aśoka instituted the Buddha's doctrine as the state philosophy of his empire, many brāhmaṇas abandoned Vedic scholarship to learn and teach nāstika concepts of ahiṁsā (nonviolence) and śūnyatā (voidism). Buddhism in its turn was eclipsed by the teachings of the Vedāntist Śaṅkarācārya, who revived the Vedic culture all over India in the seventh century after Christ. But Śaṅkarācārya's special formulation of Vedānta was itself influenced by Buddhism and is not truly representative of the original Vedānta-darśana. After Śaṅkarācārya, Vedānta was refined by the schools of great teachers (ācāryas) like Rāmānuja and Madhva. Having shed the baggage of Śaṅkarācārya's crypto-Buddhism, Vedānta philosophers brought Vedic studies back to their original form as seen in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.

Socrates (470-399 BC) is the most influential philosopher in the recorded history of the Western world. Plato was his disciple and Aristotle his grand-disciple. Socrates lived in Athens and taught a doctrine of the soul that is similar in many ways to the Vedic conception. In a 1966 Bhagavad-gītā lecture, Śrīla Prabhupāda said Socrates was a mukta-puruṣa (a liberated soul). According to his biographer Plato, Socrates was unjustly convicted for anti-state activities by the Athenean authorities, who ordered him drink poison. He did so cheerfully, and died preaching we are not these bodies to his followers.

===== Solipsism =====
From the Latin solus, (alone), and ipse, (self). A Western doctrine stating that the self is all that exists or can be known. There are two forms of solipsism: epistemological and metaphysical. The first form holds that since there is nothing to be known beyond the content of one's own consciousness, one's own consciousness is the underlying justification for, and cause of, the existence and nonexistence of knowledge of anything. The second form holds that there is no reality other than one's own self. All things are creations of one's consciousness at the moment one is conscious of them. In other words, there is no existence apart from my own awareness. Like Māyāvāda philosophy, solipsism arrives at a philosophical dead end. The questions that remain unanswered are: If my consciousness is the only reality, why can't I change the universe at will, simply by thought? And if only I myself truly exist, why am I dependent for my life, learning and happiness upon a world full of living entities that refuse to acknowledge this truth? See [[m#Māyāvāda philosophy|Māyāvāda philosophy]]..

===== Somarāja =====

===== Soma =====

===== Soul =====
the eternal living entity, who is the marginal energy, eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord; Known in Sanskrit as jīva, jīva-ātmā or ātmā, the soul is the eternal individual self, who is a tiny particle of Lord Kṛṣṇa's spiritual potency located in the heart of the material body. The symptom of the soul is consciousness, and the power of the soul is taṭastha-śakti, the power of choice. Thus the soul is responsible for his liberation or bondage, though he has no power to either liberate himself or enjoy matter. The result of his choice, whether auspicious or inauspicious, is arranged by the Supersoul. As the air is always different from the smells it carries, so the soul is always different from the material designations it assumes due to the influence of the modes of nature. How a yogī perceives the soul's direct relationship with the Supreme Soul is described in SB 11.14.45: He sees the individual souls united with the Supreme Soul, just as one sees the sun's rays completely united with the sun. The sun is jyotiṣi, the source of light. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul, is the source of the light of consciousness of all living entities. Sunlight is composed of photons, which are tiny units of light. Similarly, each individual soul (jīva-ātmā) is a tiny unit of consciousness. See [[c#Consciousness|Consciousness]], [[e#Ecstasy|Ecstasy]], [[m#Modes of nature|Modes of nature]], [[s#Supersoul|Supersoul]].

===== Sparśas =====
the consonants in the Sanskrit alphabet.

===== Spirit soul =====
Jīva (jīvātmā)-the living entity, who is an eternal soul, individual but part and parcel of the Supreme Lord.

===== Sphoṭavāda =====
Also known as śabda-tattva, sphoṭavāda is the philosophy of a metaphysical school of Sanskrit grammarians that goes back to one Sphoṭāyaṇa, whose followers include Bhartṛhari and Jayanta Bhaṭṭa. The famous karma-mīmāṁsā philosopher Madana Miśra also accepted the sphoṭavāda doctrine, though other teachers of mīmāṁsā opposed it. Accordingly, there is a continuum of vibration (ekam eva yad āmnātam), which is partless (akhaṇḍa) and unbroken (akrama), which becomes manifest in sounds (dhvani) or syllables (varṇa). The sounds and syllables are not important. They are used as aids to achieve meditation upon the underlying continuum, where the indivisible unit of meaning (sphoṭa) is realized through śabda-pūrva-yoga. When the sphoṭa is realized, liberation is achieved in the monistic absolute. Clearly, this is a form of Māyāvāda philosophy. Interestingly, Śaṅkarācārya rejected the sphoṭavāda of the grammarians. Yet he accepted the basis of the sphoṭavāda philosophy, which is the śabda-yoga of Patañjali. In his Prabodhasudhākara 13.144, Śaṅkarācārya wrote, When one's essential nature is contemplated upon for a moment or half a moment, then the subtle sound called anāhata is heard in the right ear. In 148 he explained further: If the mind is completely absorbed for a long time in that Light comprised within the subtle sound, it is surely not slated for the bondage of worldly existence again. Many modern forms of mysticism and meditation can be traced to this doctrine: Transcendental Meditation, Radha-Soami Satsang, Kirpal Singh Satsang, and so on. The subtle sound sought in these systems is the egoistic sound at the root of material existence. Beyond this, however, is the pure name (śuddha-nāma), which cannot be extracted from the ākāśa by śabda-yoga, but which must be received from the pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. What these śabda-yogīs really seek is explained by Kṛṣṇa Himself: I am the sound in ether. ... Of vibrations I am the syllable oṁ. ... Of letters I am the letter A, and among compound words I am the dual compound. ... Of poetry I am the Gāyatrī mantra. (Bg. 7.8, 10.33, 10.35) Hence, they seek Kṛṣṇa but He is to be known only by pure devotion (bhakti-yoga). See [[m#Māyāvāda philosophy|Māyāvāda philosophy]].

===== Spiritual world =====
Referred to as Vaikuṇṭha, Goloka, the supreme abode (param-dhāma), and the spiritual sky (param-vyoma), it is the transcendental, eternal, three-quarters display of Lord Kṛṣṇa's personal splendor. The names, form, qualities, activities and relationships of the spiritual world are ever-fresh and ever-free of the defects of birth, death, disease, and old age. Here the Lord displays His divine pastimes (līlā) which overflood the spiritual world with the sweetest nectar, the very life and soul of the liberated devotees who dwell there. As a tree on the bank of a river is reflected upside-down in the water, so the material world is a reflection of the spiritual world. What is highest in the spiritual world is lowest here. The highest līlā is Kṛṣṇa's conjugal affairs with the gopīs. That is reflected here as sex life, the most entangling activity for the embodied soul. See [[k#Kṛṣṇa|Kṛṣṇa]].

It was written by Śrīla Vyāsadeva as his commentary on the Vedānta-sūtra, and it deals exclusively with topics concerning the Supreme Personality of Godhead (Lord Kṛṣṇa) and His devotees. Śrīla Prabhupāda has given Bhaktivedanta purports in English and wonderfully presented it to the modern world, specifically to give a deep understanding of Lord Kṛṣṇa; Also known as the Bhāgavata Purāṇa, this is a work of eighteen thousand verses compiled by sage Vyāsa as his natural commentary on the Vedānta-sūtra. It takes up where the Bhagavad-gītā leaves off. In Bg. 4.9, Lord Kṛṣṇa says that by knowing His transcendental appearance and activities in this world, one becomes free of the cycle of repeated birth and death. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam recounts with great relish the details of the Lord's appearance and activities, beginning with His puruṣa incarnations and their līlā of cosmic manifestation, and culminating with Kṛṣṇa's own appearance in Vṛndāvana 5000 years ago, and His most sweet rasa-līlā with the His cowherd girlfriends, the gopīs headed by Rādhārāṇī.

===== Substance =====
From the Latin substare, be under, be firm, support. Substance (vastu in Sanskrit) is the underlying support of all phenomena. It is the eternal Brahman, the cause, of which the world is the effect. The Vedic view of the substance of the world is different from the Christian view, called creatio ex nihilo. According to this theory put forward by Augustine (175-242), God created the world out of nothing. Augustine's reasoning was based on the Biblical statement that in the beginning there was only God. Creatio ex nihilo was an attempt to break out of the paradoxical question, If in the beginning there was only God, and God is eternal, why is the world ever-changing? It was assumed that a doctrine of the material world's direct emanation from God's own substance could be true only if the material world had the same nature as God. But since it does not, and since God was alone in the beginning, He must have created the world from nothing. There is a paradox upon which creatio ex nihilo stumbles: ex nihilo, nihil fit, From nothing, nothing comes. According to the Vedic view, the substance of creation is tattva, true, just as God is true. The tattva of matter (prakṛti) is eternal, but it assumes temporary forms as God wills. Like a shadow, the material creation resembles the original form of the substance. But it does not have the potency of the original. Yet it has no other source than the substance. Its source is not nothing. See [[a#Absolute|Absolute]], [[b#Brahman|Brahman]].

===== Subtle body =====
Called liṅga-śarīra in Sanskrit, and also known as the astral body, the subtle body is the result of the conditioning of consciousness by the three modes of material nature. It includes the false ego, intellect and mind and is composed of cetana, consciousness under material influence. As long as the living entity remains within the cycle of saṁsāra, the subtle body is retained. But the steady practice of bhakti-yoga dissolves the subtle body, thus freeing consciousness from matter.
